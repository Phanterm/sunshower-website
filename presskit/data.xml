  <history>Sunshower was founded in Seattle, Washington in 2019. Its founder, Grayson Dazo-Kennoy, is an industry veteran who has worked for large companies such as Wizards of the Coast and Microsoft Game Studios, and multiple, smaller independent teams on projects spanning several years. Having grown up being passionate about games, they became disillusioned and frustrated with the changing state of the industry and what it had become. For them, it felt increasingly more difficult to exist in a space that had become so caught up in the idea of fame or competition, rather than letting good work speak for itself. Longing for such a space but never finding it, they set out to make their own. </history>

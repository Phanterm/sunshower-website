description: Frogatto & Friends is an action-adventure game, starring a certain quixotic frog. A quiet errand run turns into a battle to fend off an invading army, and only Frogatto is foolhardy enough to sleuth out why. Frogatto is a platformer game, where you'll be jumping, dodging, solving puzzles, and talking to all sorts of locals along the way as you travel through the wilderness to solve the mystery behind what happened.

description: Grayson is a game designer based out of Seattle, as well as the founder of Sunshower. Their earliest foray into game design was when they were a kid making notebooks full of activities and distributing copies to kids in their neighborhood. These days, Grayson can be found weeping at their desk when their code stops working.
